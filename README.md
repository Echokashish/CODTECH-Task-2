OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

 Develop a report to analyze customer demographics, including age, gender, location, and purchasing behavior. Import customer data from a database or CSV file. Create visuals to represent demographic data (e.g., age distribution, gender breakdown)

 This dashboard provides insights into annual income, purchase amounts, and demographic data segmented by location and gender. Here's the breakdown:

Sankey Chart: "Sum of Age by Gender and Location"

Represents the distribution of age across genders (Male, Female, Other) and locations (Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix).
Highlights overlaps and variations in age demographics based on gender and location.
Gauge Chart: "Sum of Annual Income"

Displays the total annual income, which is approximately 702M, against a maximum scale of 1bn.
Provides an at-a-glance view of the overall financial metric.
Area Chart: "Sum of Annual Income by Gender"

Shows annual income segmented by gender (Female, Male, Other).
Indicates that Female has the highest income share, followed by Male and then Other.
Waterfall Chart: "Sum of Purchase Amount by Location"

Breaks down the purchase amounts by location (New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, Phoenix).
Differentiates between Increase, Decrease, and the Total amount of purchases, showcasing the contribution of each city to the total purchase figure.
This dashboard is useful for analyzing income and purchase patterns across demographics and locations, enabling data-driven business or marketing decisions.
